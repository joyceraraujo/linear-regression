# linear-regression
I have concluded the course Machine Learning by Andrew NG from Coursera. The programming language of that course was Octave. My goal is rewrite all the programming exercices in Python.
Let's start with Regression Linear, the subject of WEEK 1. 

This script makes a regression linear in two ways: 
-by using the method LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model
-by using Batch Gradient Descent coded from scratch 

Metrics are evaluated in order to compare these methods.


The data set is very symple, it contains only one feature but it can be used for more features.
